# kryptomator
This is an older cocoa/objective C project.
It's goal was to offer an easy to use crypto app (ecnryption/decryption of files), which included numerous implementations of ciphers, via plug-in functionality. AES128 and RC4 should be functional. A sample ROT128 plug-in is included. It is not being maintained anymore, so use at your own risk. The code might be quite outdated. But if you find the code useful, please use it. It's licenced under GPL3.
